Steps to run this analysis:

1) Script: tankLocalFindTrackLengthInWaterVtxReco.C  creates the csv with hit positions and timing, true and reco vertex and gridpoint forthe true vertex. 

2) Script: GridpointToCoords.C converts all the gridpoints in an 1x1 fiducial volume to their coordinates in each grid center and stores them in a .csv.)

3) 20hits.py : finds the first 20 hits with respect to median and stores them in a csv file (VolumeTank_Texpected.csv).-Currently we need to fix that step to use hits before median!!!

4) LocateCentreVertex.py : converts all the gridpoints in an 1x1 fiducial volume to their coordinates in each grid center and stores them as columns in the csv from step1.
